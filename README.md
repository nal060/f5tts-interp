# f5tts-interp

This repository is a workspace for interpretability experiments with neural networks, especially text-to-speech (TTS) models. 

**Current state:**
- Contains a toy PyTorch model (`scripts/toy_model_activation_extraction.py`) demonstrating how to extract activations from layers using forward hooks.

This repo is under active development.
